📌 Overview

This project implements a Spam Mail Detection System using Logistic Regression. The model classifies emails as either Spam or Not Spam (Ham) based on their content.

🔑 Significance

Helps filter unwanted spam emails.

Reduces risks of phishing and scams.

Improves email user experience.

⚙️ Requirements

Python 3.x

Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, nltk

Install dependencies:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn nltk

🚀 Steps

Preprocess the email text (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming).

Convert text into numerical features using TF-IDF Vectorizer.

Train a Logistic Regression model.

Evaluate performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

📊 Why Logistic Regression?

Simple yet effective for binary classification.

Provides interpretable results with probability scores.

Works well with high-dimensional text data.

📈 Results

Achieved high accuracy in classifying spam vs ham emails.
